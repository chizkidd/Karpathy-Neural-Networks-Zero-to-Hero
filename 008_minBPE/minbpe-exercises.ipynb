    "Build your own GPT-4 Tokenizer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the `BasicTokenizer` class, with the following three core functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False)`\n",
    "- `def encode(self, text)`\n",
    "- `def decode(self, ids)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Train your tokenizer on whatever text you like and visualize the merged tokens. Do they look reasonable? One default test you may wish to use is the text file `tests/taylorswift.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert your `BasicTokenizer` into a `RegexTokenizer`, which takes a regex pattern and splits the text exactly as GPT-4 would. Process the parts separately as before, then concatenate the results. Retrain your tokenizer and compare the results before and after. You should see that you will now have no tokens that go across categories (numbers, letters, punctuation, more than one whitespace). Use the GPT-4 pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GPT4_SPLIT_PATTERN = r\"\"\"'(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|[^\\r\\n\\p{L}\\p{N}]?+\\p{L}+|\\p{N}{1,3}| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]++[\\r\\n]*|\\s*[\\r\\n]|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now ready to load the merges from the GPT-4 tokenizer and show that your tokenizer produces the identical results for both `encode` and `decode`, matching [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# match this\n",
    "import tiktoken\n",
    "enc = tiktoken.get_encoding(\"cl100k_base\") # this is the GPT-4 tokenizer\n",
    "ids = enc.encode(\"hello world!!!? (안녕하세요!) lol123 😉\")\n",
    "text = enc.decode(ids) # get the same text back\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you will run into two issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is not trivial to recover the raw merges from the GPT-4 tokenizer. You can easily recover what we call `vocab` here, and what they call and store under `enc._mergeable_ranks`. Feel free to copy paste the `recover_merges` function in `minbpe/gpt4.py`, which takes these ranks and returns the raw merges. If you wish to know how this function works, read [this](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/issues/60) and [this](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe/issues/11#issuecomment-1950805306). Basically, under some conditions it is enough to only store the parent nodes (and their rank) and get rid of the precise details of which children merged up to any parent.\n",
    "2. Second, the GPT-4 tokenizer for some reason permutes its raw bytes. It stores this permutation in the first 256 elements of the mergeable ranks, so you can recover this byte shuffle relatively simply as `byte_shuffle = {i: enc._mergeable_ranks[bytes([i])] for i in range(256)}`. In both your encode and decode, you'll have to shuffle bytes around accordingly. If you're stuck, reference the `minbpe/gpt4.py` file for hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4\n",
    "\n",
    "(Optional, irritating, not obviously useful) Add the ability to handle special tokens. You'll then be able to match the output of tiktoken even when special tokens are present, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import tiktoken\n",
    "enc = tiktoken.get_encoding(\"cl100k_base\") # this is the GPT-4 tokenizer\n",
    "ids = enc.encode(\"<|endoftext|>hello world\", allowed_special=\"all\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `allowed_special` tiktoken will error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've made it this far, you're now a pro at LLM Tokenization! Sadly, you're not exactly done yet because a lot of LLMs outside of OpenAI (e.g. Llama, Mistral) use [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) instead. Primary difference being that sentencepiece runs BPE directly on Unicode code points instead of on UTF-8 encoded bytes. Feel free to explore sentencepiece on your own (good luck, it's not too pretty), and stretch goal if you really experience and suffer from the burden of time, re-write your BPE to be on Unicode code points and match the Llama 2 tokenizer."

    "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\n",
    "Swift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n",
    "After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\n",
    "One of the world's best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\n",

    "Swift's childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\n",
    "Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\n",
    "Swift's mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\n",
    "Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\n",
    "At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\n",
    "When Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\n",
    "2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\n",
    "In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\n",

    "Swift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\n",
    "At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\n",
    "Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\n",
    "Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\n",
    "Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\n",

    "Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift's honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008–2009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart.[77] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009's top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]\n",
    "In 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]\n",
    "Swift featured on John Mayer's single \"Half of My Heart\" and Boys Like Girls' single \"Two Is Better Than One\", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the US Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode,[100] and she hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]\n",

    "Prior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[158] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that its ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[159] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[160] The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[161] and Swift agreed to let 1989 on the streaming service.[162] She then returned her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[163] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[164] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[165] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A.

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a \"bitch\".[173][174]\n",

    "Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's 1971 album Blue as a favorite \"because it explores somebody's soul so deeply\".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]\n",

    "Swift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"[309]\n",
    "Music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\n",

    "The Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\n",

    "In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\n",
    "Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\n",
    "On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\n",
    "Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[390]\n",

Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[403]\n",

    "Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[486][487] She dominates cultural conversations,[488][489] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[490][491][492] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[297] Initially a teen idol,[493] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[312][494] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[495][496] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\n",
