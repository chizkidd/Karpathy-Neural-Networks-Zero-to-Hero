    "---------------------------------\n",
    "We build a GPT, following the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" and OpenAI's GPT-2 / GPT-3. We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!). We'll utilise the small \"[Tiny Shakespeare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn/master/data/tiny-shakespeare.txt)\" dataset, which contains all of Shakespeare's work in a single file under $1$ MB, instead of a bigger chunk-sized entire internet dataset. This will tremendously reduce our parameter size from the billions. For simplicity and speed, our input tokens will be characters and not words. It's essential to watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework, and basics of tensors & `PyTorch`'s **`torch.nn`**, which we take for granted in this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT** is a language model (LM) developed & designed by OpenAI to understand and generate human-like text sequentially based on the input it receives. You can use it for various natural language processing tasks, such as answering questions, having conversations, generating text, and more. For the same input, it provides different outputs when it's rerun numerous times. This shows that it's a probabilistic LM.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Generative Pre-trained Transformer,</u> otherwise known as **GPT**, is a LM that is trained on a siginificant large size of text data to understand and generate human-like text sequentially. The \"transformer\" part refers to the model's architecture, which was introduced and inspired by the 2017 \"[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)\" paper.\n",

    "-----------\n",
    "A **tokenizer** is a component used in natural language processing (NLP) to convert raw text of strings into some sequence of integers known as \"<u>tokens</u>\". An **encoder** allows us turn tokens represented as strings into integers, and a **decoder** allows us to turn our tokens represented as integers back into strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a very simple character-level tokenizer. There are many different tokenizers, like Google's [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) schema (**a subword tokenizer**) or OpenAI's [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) (**a byte pair encoding, BPE, tokenizer**). These tokenizers operate fundamentally on a sub-word level, which means their vocabulary is much larger (since there are many more permutations of subwords than characters). But the general idea remains the same, we are just turning strings into integers and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large vocabulary size of <u>tiktoken</u>, which is $50257$, enables us to encode a string to a shorter sequence of integers as compared to our own tokenizer of size 65 which generates a longer sequence of integer tokens. The larger the vocabulary size, the shorter the sequence of integer tokens.\n",

Embedding a single integer between `0` and `vocab_size-1` would return a tensor of length `vocab_size`. This acts like a lookup table, where passing in a row index between `0` and `vocab_size-1` would return a row with length `vocab_size`. We simply initialize an embedding that maps each token to a probability distribution for the next token.\n",

    "If we pass in a multi-demensional vector as input, the embedding simply returns a tensor with the same dimensions, excecpt each integer gets turned into a vector of `vocab_size`. For example, if we pass in an input with dimensions `BxT`, then the output will be have dimension `BxTxC`.\n",

    "**Attention** is a communication mechanism that allows models to focus on different parts of the input data when making predictions. This concept is especially important in sequence-based NLP tasks such as machine translation and text summarization, and image processing tasks such as image captioning. It helps models pick out the important bits from a lot of information and focus on them to make smarter decisions. It overcomes the long-range dependency limitations of RNNs & LSTMs by allowing the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the sequence. Instead of processing each element sequentially, attention enables the model to look at all elements simultaneously and decide which ones are more relevant to the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the **query, keys, values**, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, attention is good for capturing long-range dependencies, parallel processing, and making model decisions more interpretable.\n",

    "\n",
    "The easiset way to make them communicate is by averaging the previous tokens embeddings. This is a weak form of interaction, it is extremely lossy since we are losing the spatial information of the token arrangements and positions."

Both methods are similar in theretical complexity, however dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n",

    "While for small values of ${d_k}$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of ${d_k}$. We suspect that for large values of ${d_k}$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. Let's illustrate why the dot products get large. If we assume that $q$ and $k$ are ${d_k}$-dimensional vectors whose components are independent random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Then their dot product, $q \\cdot k = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_ik_i$, has mean $0$ and variance $d_k$. To counteract this effect for large values of ${d_k}$ (since we would prefer these values to have variance $1$), we scale the dot-product by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$."

    "## 2.8. $6$ Key Notes on Attention\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. It can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "  - It contains a directed graph and each node aggregates information via a weighted sum of the nodes pointed towards it. This is done in a data-dependent manner.\n",
    "- Attention **does not have a notion of space.** It simply acts over a set of vectors. This is <u>why we need to positionally encode tokens.</u> \n",
    "  - Thus, we have to encode the node positionally, which was done through a positional encoding. In contrast, convolutional mechanisms have a concrete layout of information in the space. There is no notion of space. \n",
    "-  There is **no communication across batch dimension.**\n",
    "  - <u>Each example</u> across batch dimension is of course **processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other.**\n",
    "- In an **\"encoder\"** attention block, it justs delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. The masking block here is called a **\"decoder\"** attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling. \n",
    "  - In some cases, we must allow every node to talk to each other. (Ex: Sentiment analysis, the process of analyzing digital text to determine the emotional tone of a message). Thus, we will use an **encoder block** of self-attention. It simply deletes the lower triangular mask step and lets all the nodes communicate. In **decoder blocks**, future nodes will never communicate with the current node as masking step is active.\n",
    "- <a id='c102'></a>**\"self-attention\"** just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In **\"cross-attention,\"** the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "  - Our implementation is called **self-attention** since both keys, queries, and values are coming from the same source, thus the nodes are self-attending. In **cross-attention**, keys and values might be generated from a different set of nodes.\n",
    "- **\"Scaled\" self-attention** additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below\n",
    "  - In the ‘**Attention is all you need**’ paper, the attention weights are divided by $\\sqrt{head\\_size}$. This will allow `wei` to have a unit variance. This is important since wei is fed to a softmax layer. If `wei` have large positive or negative numbers during the initialization, the softmax will be converged to one-hot vectors."

They are very simple (add a block's input to its output), but at the same time are very useful: they ease the gradient flow through a network and allow stacking of multiple layers. The intuition is that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers. Having skip connections allows the network to more easily learn identity-like mappings.\n",

    "In the $2$nd figure above on the right, the computation follows a residual pathway with addition operations connecting the inputs to the targets. The residual pathway  allows intermediate computations to fork off and rejoin through addition. This residual design allows gradients during backpropagation to flow unimpeded from the loss all the way to the inputs via the addition operations, creating a **\"gradient superhighway.\"** The residual blocks are initially initialized to contribute very little, essentially bypassing them at first. However, during training, these residual blocks gradually come online (into play) and start contributing to the computation & improving the optimization. This architecture helps optimize the model effectively by enabling direct and unobstructed gradient flow initially, while allowing the residual blocks to adapt and contribute over time. The combination of the residual pathway and the gradual incorporation of residual blocks dramatically improves the optimization process.\n",

    "Another [article](https://medium.com/@adachoudhry26/deep-dive-into-ai-building-gpt-from-scratch-aff87c804117) states that **residual connection** is when we add identity mapping in addition to the output before passing it to the next layer. This is another way of saying that we add the input to the output before passing it onto the next layer. **This solves the problem of exploding or vanishing gradients seen in feed-forward neural networks** because in these networks the path length for output is proportional to the number of layers. On adding more layers, the gradient explodes because the resultant output is huge compared to the outputs of neurons in the initial layers. This makes the network during backpropagation unstable.\n",

    "So far we've implemented a decoder-only transformer similar to the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model but different from the full transformer architecture that includes an encoder and cross-attention blocks. Our model only has self-attention and feed-forward layers, using a triangular mask for autoregressive text generation. This decoder-only setup utilizes a triangular mask for self-attention, enabling autoregressive text generation capabilities. This setup is suitable for unconditioned text generation, like GPT as it can be used to predict the next word in a sequence, and for language modeling, where the input sequence is not needed. This is useful for tasks like language translation, text summarization, and chatbots. The decoder-only transformer is trained on a large corpus of text, such as the internet, and can generate text that is similar in style and structure to the training data.\n",

It consists of two key files: `train.py` for training and `model.py` for the model. The training script handles more complex tasks like checkpointing, learning rate decay, and distributed training. The model file closely resembles our implementation but **optimizes multi-headed attention for efficiency.** In summary, the code includes the transformer model, the training loop, and the data loading code, and can be used to train a chatGPT model. However, training large language models like GPT-3 involves a two-stage process: **pre-training and fine-tuning.** "

    "We trained a small decoder-only transformer inspired by GPT, demonstrating its capability on a tiny Shakespeare dataset. While our model is much smaller, the principles are the same as those used in large-scale models like GPT-3.

For practical applications beyond text generation, further fine-tuning stages are necessary.\n",

More advanced methods, such as training a reward model and using PPO, can be used to fine-tune the model for more complex tasks or alignment goals.

    "1. The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in `nanoGPT`).\n",
    "2. Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be fun to blabber on about? \n",
    "    - A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. `a+b=c`. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of `c` in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of `train.bin`, `val.bin`. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of `a+b` that just specify the problem using `y=-1` in the targets (see `CrossEntropyLoss :ignore_index`. \n",
    "    - Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of `+-*/`. _Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces_.)\n",
    "3. Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?\n",
    "4. Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT?"
